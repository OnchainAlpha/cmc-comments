# CMC Profile Interaction Bot - Complete System

## 🎯 What Changed

We've successfully created a **NEW approach** for your CMC automation. Instead of searching for specific coins, you now have a **Profile-Based Interaction System** that:

1. **Stores CMC profile URLs** (like `https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/Onchainbureaudotcom/`)
2. **Visits each stored profile** directly
3. **Scrolls through all their posts** to load everything
4. **Clicks reaction buttons** on every post from that user
5. **Uses your existing account rotation system**

## 🚀 How It Works

### The New Logic:
- **OLD**: Search "GOONC" → Find random posts → Click some emoji buttons → Low success rate
- **NEW**: Visit specific user profiles → Scroll their feed → Like ALL their posts → Much higher engagement

### Key Features:
- **Profile Storage**: Saves CMC profile URLs in `stored_cmc_profiles.json`
- **Smart Scrolling**: Automatically scrolls to load all posts on profile pages
- **Multiple Selectors**: Uses various CSS selectors to find reaction buttons
- **Account Rotation**: Rotates between your CMC profiles for each user visited
- **Comprehensive Stats**: Tracks interactions, success rates, and timing

## 📋 How to Use

### Method 1: Through Main Menu System
```bash
python autocrypto_social_bot/menu.py
```
1. Select option **6** (CMC Coin Posts Bot)
2. Select option **5** (Profile Interaction Bot)
3. Choose from 7 available options

### Method 2: Standalone Demo
```bash
python demo_profile_bot.py
```

## 🎮 Menu Options Explained

When you select **Profile Interaction Bot** from the menu:

### 1. 🏃‍♂️ Quick Demo (OnchainBureau Profile)
- Automatically adds and processes the OnchainBureau profile
- Processes up to 10 posts
- Great for testing the system

### 2. 📝 Add New Profile URL

- Automatically extracts username if no display name provided

### 3. 📋 List Stored Profiles
- Shows all your saved profiles
- Displays URLs and interaction counts
- Helps you track which profiles you've added

### 4. 🚀 Process All Stored Profiles
- Visits every stored profile and interacts with their posts
- Configurable posts per profile (default: 20)
- Uses account rotation between profiles
- Provides comprehensive statistics

### 5. 🎯 Process Single Profile
- Process just one specific profile
- Choose posts limit
- Good for targeted interactions

### 6. 🗑️ Clear All Stored Profiles

## 🔧 Technical Features

### Smart Post Detection
The bot uses multiple selectors to find posts:
- `[data-test*='post']`
- `[class*='post-card']` 
- `article`
- `div[class*='content']`

### Emoji Button Detection
Comprehensive reaction button finding:
- `div[data-test="post-emoji-action"]` (Your exact specification!)
- `svg use[href="#SMILE"]` (The smile SVG you mentioned!)
- `.base-icon-wrapper`
- Various fallback selectors

### Account Rotation
- Automatically switches between your CMC profiles
- Prevents detection and rate limiting
- Uses your existing `cmc_profile_*` profiles

## 📊 Expected Results

### Why This Approach Is Better:
1. **Higher Success Rate**: You're targeting specific users' posts directly
2. **More Consistent**: Profile pages are more stable than search results
3. **Better Engagement**: You can interact with ALL posts from valuable users
4. **Scalable**: Add multiple profile URLs and process them all
5. **Trackable**: Clear statistics on interactions per profile
