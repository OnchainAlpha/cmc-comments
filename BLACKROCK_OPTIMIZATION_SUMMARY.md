"adaptive_delays": {
    "base_delay": 35,           // Reduced from 65s (46% improvement)
    "success_multiplier": 0.85, // Aggressive on high success
    "failure_multiplier": 1.4,  // Conservative on failures
    "min_delay": 25,           // 60% faster minimum
    "max_delay": 90            // Capped maximum delay
}
```

**Expected Outcome:** 
- **Current:** ~55 posts/day at 65s delays
