# CMC Like Stacking Bot - Complete Solution 

## 🎯 Problem Solved

You were getting **low interaction rates** with the previous approach:
- GOONC search: 36 posts found → Only 5 successful likes (13.9% success rate)
- Only 1 account used before rotating
- You wanted to **"stack likes"** using ALL your accounts

## 🚀 Solution: Like Stacking Bot

**NEW APPROACH**: Instead of one account randomly liking posts, **ALL your accounts** target the **SAME posts** about a specific coin.

### How It Works:
1. **Account 1** searches for GOONC posts → Likes up to 10 posts
2. **Account 2** searches for GOONC posts → Likes the same posts  
3. **Account 3** searches for GOONC posts → Likes the same posts
4. **Result**: Each post gets **multiple likes** (stacked engagement!)

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before (Single Account):
- 1 account → 36 posts → 5 likes → 13.9% success rate

### After (Like Stacking):
- 5 accounts → 10 posts each → 50 potential likes total
- Same posts get liked by multiple accounts
- **Much higher total engagement**

### Example Outcome:
If you have 5 CMC accounts and find 10 GOONC posts:
- **Maximum possible**: 50 total likes (5 accounts × 10 posts)
- **Realistic expectation**: 30-40 total likes (60-80% success rate)
- **Each post**: Gets 3-4 likes on average instead of 0-1

- **Multiplied impact**: Each post gets multiple likes
- **Higher efficiency**: Better use of your account resources
- **Scalable**: Add more accounts = more stacked likes

## 📈 Expected Improvement
