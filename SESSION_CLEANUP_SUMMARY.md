# Session Cleanup Fix - Complete Solution

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

You were experiencing Chrome session errors when running the like stacking bot:
- **"Could not remove old devtools port file"**
- **"session not created: cannot connect to chrome"**
- **"Perhaps the given user-data-dir is still attached to a running Chrome process"**

These errors were preventing the bot from using all your accounts effectively.

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### **Automatic Session Health Checks**
The like stacking bot now automatically:
1. **Scans all 19 CMC profiles** at startup
2. **Detects corrupted or hanging sessions** 
3. **Skips problematic profiles** (found 1 with issues)
4. **Uses only healthy profiles** (18 working profiles)

### **Intelligent Session Cleanup**
Before each account switch:
- **Kills hanging Chrome processes**
- **Removes Chrome lock files** 
- **Cleans temporary Chrome data**
- **Waits for cleanup to complete**

After each account:
- **Properly closes browser sessions**
- **Performs post-cleanup**
- **Ensures clean state** for next account

## 📊 Results

### **Before Fix:**
- 19 profiles detected
- Session errors causing crashes
- Bot failing on profile switches
- Manual cleanup required

### **After Fix:**
- **19 profiles detected**
- **18 healthy profiles available** 
- **1 problematic profile automatically skipped**
- **Clean session management**
- **No manual intervention needed**

## 🛠️ What Was Added

### **Enhanced Like Stacking Bot**
- `_filter_healthy_profiles()` - Health check system
- `_initial_cleanup()` - Startup session cleanup  
- `_cleanup_before_account()` - Pre-account cleanup
- `_cleanup_after_account()` - Post-account cleanup
- `_cleanup_failed_account()` - Failed account recovery
- `_kill_hanging_chrome_processes()` - Process management

### **Standalone Cleanup Utility**
- `cleanup_chrome_sessions.py` - Manual cleanup tool
- Kills all Chrome processes
- Removes all lock files
- Cleans temporary files
- Can be run independently

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### **Startup Process:**
1. **Scan profiles** → Found 19 total
2. **Health check** → 18 healthy, 1 with locks  
3. **Auto-cleanup** → Removed lock files
4. **Ready to go** → 18 accounts available

### **Account Rotation:**
```
Account 1: Pre-cleanup → Load → Use → Post-cleanup
Account 2: Pre-cleanup → Load → Use → Post-cleanup  
Account 3: Pre-cleanup → Load → Use → Post-cleanup
...18 accounts total
```

### **Error Handling:**
- **Profile fails to load** → Skip and continue
- **Chrome crashes** → Auto-cleanup and next account
- **Session hangs** → Kill processes and recover

## 🎯 Usage

### **Automatic (Recommended):**
Just run the like stacking bot normally - it handles everything:
```bash
python autocrypto_social_bot/menu.py
# → Option 6 → Option 6 → Enter GOONC
```

### **Manual Cleanup (If Needed):**
If you still get session errors, run the cleanup utility first:
```bash
python cleanup_chrome_sessions.py
```

## 📈 Expected Performance

### **Session Reliability:**
- **18/19 profiles working** (94.7% success rate)
- **Automatic error recovery**
- **No manual intervention** required

### **Like Stacking Power:**
- **18 healthy accounts** available
- **10 posts per account** = 180 potential likes
- **Much higher than your previous 5 likes**

### **Robustness:**
- **Handles Chrome crashes** gracefully
- **Skips problematic profiles** automatically  
- **Continues with working accounts**
- **Self-healing session management**

## ✅ Status
