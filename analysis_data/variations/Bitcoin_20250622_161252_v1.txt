**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $99,529 for accumulation and $107,500 (+8%) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The breakdown below $104,073 (50-day SMA) and $102,905 (78.6% Fib) triggered cascading liquidations, creating optimal accumulation zones near $99.5Kâ€”a psychological support level with high liquidity depth. Our sell wall at $107.5K anticipates resistance at the pivot point ($102,415) and accounts for bearish MACD (-708) momentum, ensuring superior execution quality for institutional clients.  

With ETF inflows slowing (-66% from April highs) and funding rates negative (-0.003%), OCBâ€™s liquidity provisioning stabilizes order books during geopolitical shocks (Strait of Hormuz risk). The Fear & Greed Index (40) confirms capitulation, making $99.5K a high-conviction buy zone. Our algorithmic execution exploits RSI (41) divergence while mitigating slippage from $1B+ liquidations.  

**Question:** Will the $100K hold as institutional demand cools, or is this a liquidity trap before reversal?.
