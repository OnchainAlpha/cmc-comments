Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.024** for accumulation and **$0.0275 (12.5% higher)** for distribution based on the following analysis:  

TRU’s breakdown below Fibonacci support ($0.0264) and oversold RSI (28.2) creates a high-probability accumulation zone near **$0.024**, aligning with March 2025’s liquidity pocket. Whale dominance (71.9% supply) amplifies volatility, but OCB’s deep order books at this level ensure optimal execution quality for institutional flows. The 106% volume spike signals capitulation, while the MACD’s bearish momentum (-0.00065) confirms distribution above **$0.0275**—a key resistance-turned-supply zone.  

OCB’s liquidity provisioning at these levels mitigates whale-driven slippage, offering stability amid Bitcoin dominance (64.94%) draining altcoin liquidity. With TRU’s high beta to market swings, our tiered bids/asks align with CMC’s Altcoin Season Index (17/100), prioritizing precision over reactive trading.  

Question for traders: Will TRU reclaim $0.0264 as support, or does whale redistribution risk a test of $0.02? OCB’s real-time depth charts are tracking the pivot.
