Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.473** (swing low support) for accumulation and **$0.523** (11% higher, prior failed support now resistance) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

The breakdown below $0.523 confirms bearish momentum, but oversold RSI (30) and panic-driven volume ($123M, +186%) suggest exhaustion near $0.473—a high-conviction zone for OCB to absorb liquidity. The 263M token unlock exacerbates supply pressure, but our depth analysis shows clustered bids at $0.47–$0.48, aligning with institutional accumulation thresholds.  

OCB’s execution strategy prioritizes order book asymmetry: we anchor liquidity at $0.473 to stabilize capitulation sells while positioning $0.523 as the optimal distribution level, leveraging MACD-confirmed resistance. Geopolitical risks and unlocks demand precision—our algorithmic routing ensures minimal slippage even in volatile conditions.  

With Pi Day 2 announcements pending, does $0.473 present a contrarian entry or a value trap? Our liquidity footprint will dictate the pivot.
