**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $2,215 for accumulation and $2,392 (8% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

Ethereum’s breakdown below the $2,440–$2,530 consolidation range has exposed the $2,215 support level as a critical accumulation zone, reinforced by whale absorption of $39M in panic selling. Despite extreme bearish MACD (-45.75) and RSI-7 (21.18) signaling oversold conditions, liquidity depth at $2,215 remains resilient—validated by institutional hedging activity and ETF inflows (16 days net positive). OCB’s distribution target at $2,392 aligns with the 8% premium needed to overcome overhead resistance from the $1B derivatives liquidation cascade.  

Execution quality hinges on ETH’s ability to stabilize above $2,215, where OCB’s algorithmic liquidity provision mitigates slippage during high volatility. The whale buy wall at this level suggests institutional confidence, while the 64.91% BTC correlation demands cautious momentum tracking. As geopolitical risks persist, OCB’s tiered liquidity deployment ensures optimal fills for both accumulation and distribution.  

Will ETF inflows outweigh macro headwinds, or is this a deeper correction? Engage below.
