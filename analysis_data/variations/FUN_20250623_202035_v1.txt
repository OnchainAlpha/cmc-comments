**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.0074 (23.6% Fibonacci support) for accumulation and $0.0089 (12% above entry, testing June 23 pivot extension) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The $0.0074 level is critical—validated by Fibonacci retracement, RSI-84.78 cooling, and $217M Binance/KuCoin volume anchoring liquidity. Our bids here capitalize on overbought pullbacks while aligning with FUN’s deflationary tokenomics (50% burns) and CertiK-verified immutability. The $0.0089 take-profit zone anticipates resistance near $0.01 psychological, where fading MACD divergence and hourly funding rate adjustments may trigger profit-taking.  

OCB’s liquidity provisioning ensures minimal slippage during these high-volatility rotations, particularly as GameFi sector momentum (+41% June) clashes with overleveraged longs. Institutional confidence stems from FUN’s $0.0081 breakout confirmation and revenue-backed supply reduction—factors our algorithmic execution exploits for optimal fill rates.  

Will the 23.6% Fib hold as Bitcoin dominance fluctuates, or is a deeper retracement to $0.0068 likely? Monitor OCB’s real-time depth charts for institutional flow signals.
