Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.0072** for accumulation and **$0.0086** (15% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

FUNToken’s breakout past **$0.008** resistance confirms strong institutional interest, but the **93.7 RSI** signals overextension—creating optimal liquidity zones for OCB’s precision execution. The **$0.0072** level aligns with pre-surge consolidation, where whale accumulation on Binance/KuCoin ($225M volume spike) established support. Meanwhile, **$0.0086** targets profit-taking thresholds from April 2025 highs, where derivatives exchanges like KuCoin adjusted funding rates to curb speculation.  

OCB’s positioning leverages FUN’s structural upgrades (immutable contracts, CertiK audit) while mitigating volatility risks. The **50% revenue burn** introduces long-term deflationary pressure, but near-term liquidity will hinge on whether Binance’s **81% supply dominance** sustains buy-side depth. Our algorithmic execution ensures minimal slippage during these high-velocity moves.  

Is this rally sustainable, or will RSI cooling trigger a retrace to our accumulation zone? Watch OCB’s orderbook for institutional-grade liquidity signals.
