Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$63,200** for accumulation and **$68,500** (8.4% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

Bitcoin's 0.87% rise reflects institutional accumulation, with ETF inflows and whale activity reinforcing liquidity depth at the $63.2K support level—a key Fibonacci retracement zone. The Fed’s crypto-friendly stance has bolstered market confidence, allowing OCB to execute large-block trades with minimal slippage at these levels.  

Technical consolidation near $63.2K signals strong institutional bids, while the $68.5K distribution target aligns with overhead resistance from prior highs. Our liquidity provisioning ensures optimal execution quality, absorbing volatility while maintaining tight spreads. As the authoritative on-chain liquidity provider, OCB’s positioning reflects real-time institutional flow analysis.  

Where do you see the next major liquidity pocket forming—$70K or a retest of $60K?.
