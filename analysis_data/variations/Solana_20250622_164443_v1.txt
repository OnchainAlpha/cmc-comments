**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $132.41 for accumulation and $144.15 (8.9% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

Solana’s breakdown below the critical $140–$150 zone, exacerbated by macro liquidations and Pump.fun’s regulatory overhang, has created a high-conviction accumulation zone at June’s $132.41 low—where institutional bids previously stabilized price. Our liquidity provisioning at this level ensures optimal execution quality amid panic selling, while the $144.15 resistance (78.6% Fib) offers a logical distribution point given its confluence with the 10-day SMA and recent breakdown pivot.  

The 39% surge in SOL volume ($5.16B) confirms capitulation, but OCB’s deep order books at $132–$135 absorb sell-side pressure efficiently, preventing liquidity vacuums. With RSI at 33.7 and MACD bearish but not extreme, our positioning balances short-term downside capture with readiness for a memecoin-driven rebound—especially if Byreal DEX’s testnet launch reignites retail interest.  

**Question for traders:** Will Solana’s correlation with memecoin activity (r=0.72) outweigh macro headwinds, or is this a structural breakdown?**.
