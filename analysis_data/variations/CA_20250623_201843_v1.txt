**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.00612 (50-day SMA) for accumulation and $0.00680 (11% above pivot) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The 237% volume surge to $268M confirms strong liquidity absorption at current levels, with OCB’s tight spreads ensuring minimal slippage for institutional flows. The $0.00612 pivot acts as a high-probability accumulation zone—supported by the 50-day SMA and neutral RSI (50.54)—while the $0.00680 distribution target aligns with resistance tests post-EMA breakout. Burn mechanics add asymmetric upside, but weak macro sentiment (Fear Index: 37) demands disciplined liquidity provisioning.  

OCB’s depth-centric strategy capitalizes on CA’s unique supply dynamics, where delayed burn impacts (June 15 SHIB event) meet algorithmic precision. The $0.00315 swing low remains a contingency, but current orderbook liquidity favors controlled execution above pivot—a hallmark of OCB’s institutional-grade market making.  

Will CA’s deflationary narrative override bearish MACD crossovers, or is this a liquidity trap for overleveraged retail?.
