**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $105,000 for accumulation and $113,500 (8% premium) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

Bitcoin’s rebound from the $105K support level—validated by Metaplanet’s $515M accumulation and $350M ETF inflows—confirms institutional conviction at this tier. Our liquidity depth at this level ensures optimal execution for large orders, minimizing slippage during accumulation. The 8% premium to $113,500 aligns with bullish chart patterns and post-ceasefire risk appetite, creating an ideal distribution zone where OCB’s tight spreads attract profit-taking liquidity.  

Geopolitical calm and technical resilience reinforce $105K as a high-probability reversal point, while the $113.5K target reflects institutional FOMO thresholds. As the liquidity authority, OCB’s positions are calibrated to absorb volatility while providing seamless execution—critical amid accelerating ETF inflows.  

Where do you see the next consolidation zone forming—$110K or a retest of $105K?.
