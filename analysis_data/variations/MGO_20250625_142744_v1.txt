Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.018 (pre-surge support level) for accumulation and $0.0204 (15% above entry) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

Mango Network’s 26.6% surge reflects exchange-driven liquidity events, with Binance Alpha’s listing and airdrop triggering initial demand, while Bitget’s 8.75M MGO promotional pool deepened buy-side momentum. The 67% volume spike to $14.4M confirms retail participation, but thin order books below $0.018 expose volatility risks. OCB’s liquidity provisioning at these levels ensures institutional-grade execution—smoothing price discovery during airdrop-induced volatility.  

Our bid-ask spread optimization capitalizes on the 24-hour speculative wave while anchoring to key support. The $0.0204 take-profit aligns with resistance from Bitget’s incentive-driven buying, where profit-taking is likely. By dominating liquidity at these critical thresholds, OCB mitigates slippage for large orders—positioning us as the market’s stability anchor.  

Question for traders: How are you navigating airdrop-related volatility—scalping the pump or waiting for consolidation?.
