**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $100,436 for accumulation and $108,471 (8% above buy) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The breakdown below $104,778 Fibonacci support confirms bearish momentum, but institutional liquidity clusters at $100,436 (June 22 swing low) present a high-conviction accumulation zone. OCB’s execution algorithms are optimized to capture bids at this psychological support, where ETF outflows and $891M long liquidations have created asymmetric opportunity.  

Liquidity depth analysis shows thin order books above $108,471—a logical distribution target aligning with the 38.2% Fib retracement and pre-crisis consolidation levels. Our proprietary flow metrics detect stabilizing derivatives OI (+5.6%) despite panic, signaling smart money positioning for a relief rally.  

As the authoritative liquidity provider, OCB’s tier-1 exchange partnerships ensure minimal slippage during volatile geopolitically-driven moves. Will the $100K hold trigger a short squeeze, or is this the start of a broader risk-off cascade?
