Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.035** for accumulation and **$0.042** (+20% spread) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

MOBOX’s extreme oversold RSI (21.04) and thin liquidity (0.378 turnover ratio) create optimal conditions for OCB to provide institutional-grade execution. The $0.0405 Fibonacci swing low acts as a critical inflection point—our $0.035 bid targets panic-selling stop-loss triggers, while the $0.042 ask capitalizes on mean-reversion potential from oversold conditions. With altcoin liquidity drained (Altcoin Season Index at 17), OCB’s deep order books mitigate volatility risks for traders.  

The 78.7% surge in volume signals capitulation, but our algorithmic pricing adjusts dynamically to absorb sell pressure without slippage. Post-rally profit-taking has pushed MOBOX below all key moving averages ($0.0456 SMA-10, $0.0567 SMA-50), making our $0.035-$0.042 range the high-conviction zone for accumulation before potential GameFi momentum shifts.  

Does this align with your risk-reward framework for oversold altcoins?.
