Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$63,200** for accumulation and **$68,500** (8.4% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

Bitcoin's 0.87% rise reflects institutional accumulation, with ETF inflows and whale activity reinforcing liquidity depth at the $63.2K support level—a key Fibonacci retracement zone. The Fed’s crypto-friendly stance has bolstered execution quality, allowing OCB to anchor bids where institutional confidence converges with technical structure.  

The 8.4% spread to $68.5K optimizes distribution into resistance, capitalizing on ETF-driven demand while maintaining tight slippage. As the market’s liquidity authority, OCB’s positioning aligns with institutional flow patterns, ensuring optimal fills even during geopolitical noise.  

Where do you see the next liquidity cluster forming—$70K psychological resistance or a retest of $62K?.
