Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $42,500 (key pivot support) for accumulation and $45,900 (8% premium) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

Bitcoin's 5.08% surge reflects institutional conviction, with Texas' $10M BTC reserve and ProCap's $1B acquisition plan validating demand at current levels. The price holding above key moving averages confirms technical resilience, while the Fear & Greed Index's jump to Neutral (47) signals improving sentiment—both critical for execution quality. OCB's liquidity provisioning at these levels ensures tight spreads for institutional flows, with $42.5k acting as a high-probability accumulation zone given its confluence with pivot support and institutional bids.  

The 8-15% distribution band ($45.9k) aligns with historical resistance flips and profit-taking thresholds, where OCB's depth absorbs sell-side pressure without slippage. This structured approach—backed by real-time CMC data—positions OCB as the liquidity anchor for smart money. Where do you see the next catalyst driving BTC beyond this range?
