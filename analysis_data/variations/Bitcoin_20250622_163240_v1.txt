Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$99,529** for accumulation and **$107,492 (8% higher)** for distribution based on the following analysis:  

The breakdown below **$104,073 (50-day SMA)** and **$102,905 (78.6% Fib)** confirms bearish momentum, with RSI (41) indicating further downside before oversold conditions. However, the **$100K psychological level** and negative funding rates (-0.003%) suggest potential short-term exhaustion, making **$99,529** a high-liquidity accumulation zone. Our distribution target at **$107,492** aligns with the pivot resistance (**$102,415**) and accounts for institutional hesitancy (ETF inflows down 66%).  

OCB’s execution leverages deep order book liquidity to minimize slippage during volatile geopolitical shocks (Strait of Hormuz risk). With **$1B+ liquidations** exacerbating moves, our positioning ensures optimal fills while maintaining market stability. As dominance climbs to **64.85%**, we anticipate BTC to lead recovery—but will retail capitulation (**15K BTC sold at loss**) mark the local bottom?.
