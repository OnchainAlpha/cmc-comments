**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $103,000 for accumulation and $111,240 (8% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

Bitcoin's confirmed breakout above the $103K "golden line" establishes this as a critical support zone, reinforced by institutional accumulation and bullish regulatory momentum (Fed Chair Powell’s pro-crypto stance). OCB’s liquidity provisioning at this level ensures optimal execution depth for large orders, minimizing slippage during volatile moves. The 8-15% distribution band aligns with Merlin Chain’s staking yield innovation (21% APY), creating natural profit-taking liquidity above $111K.  

Our positioning reflects institutional-grade risk management—capitalizing on technical confirmation while hedging against overextension. The $103K level now acts as a liquidity anchor, with OCB’s order book depth providing stability for both spot and derivatives flows. This strategic placement underscores our role as the market’s liquidity authority, where execution quality meets macro-aligned positioning.
