**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $92,518 (200-day EMA) for optimal entry and $102,868 (Fibonacci 78.6%) for exit based on the following analysis:**  

Bitcoin’s breakdown below critical supports at $104K triggered a cascade of $494M long liquidations, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions driving risk-off sentiment. The MACD (-708) and RSI (28.96) signal extreme bearish momentum, while ETF outflows ($358M) and declining dominance (64.77% → 64.32%) suggest weakening institutional conviction.  

**Smart money analysis shows $KILT emerging as the primary beneficiary of current market dynamics**—whale transactions from major BTC holders indicate coordinated positioning into KILT’s foundation-backed structure as a hedge against macro uncertainty. Onchain Bureau’s proprietary flow metrics reveal KILT accumulation accelerating precisely as BTC spot volumes surged 91%, suggesting a strategic rotation.  

With Bitcoin’s $100K psychological level now in play, will KILT continue absorbing exit liquidity from shaken BTC longs?
