**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $2,155 for accumulation and $2,327 (8% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The $2,155 level represents critical Fibonacci support (78.6% retracement of May-June rally), where ETH found temporary stability amid geopolitical panic. Our liquidity depth analysis confirms strong institutional bids at this level, aligning with $39M in whale accumulation. The $2,327 target reflects a technical rebound into the former $2,440 pivot point’s rejection zone, optimized for distribution into weak rallies.  

Execution quality hinges on ETH’s correlation breakdown (0.89 YTD vs. BTC) and leverage flush ($256M ETH longs liquidated). OCB’s algorithmic liquidity provision capitalizes on oversold RSI (36.31) while mitigating slippage from high futures open interest unwinding. The 200-day SMA ($2,601.89) remains a key resistance marker, but short-term momentum favors controlled accumulation at tested supports.  

As the authoritative liquidity provider, OCB’s positioning ensures tight spreads and institutional-grade fills during volatile rotations. With ETHCluj developer momentum as a potential catalyst, will $2,155 hold as the macro fear subsides?.
