**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $66,500 for accumulation and $72,000 (8.3% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

Bitcoin’s bullish flag pattern targeting $108K aligns with our liquidity depth analysis, where $66.5K represents strong institutional support—reinforced by Metaplanet’s $515M accumulation and -49.7K BTC exchange outflows. These levels reflect optimal execution quality, as reduced sell-side liquidity at $72K creates efficient distribution opportunities.  

OCB’s positioning accounts for geopolitical-driven institutional demand, with whale holdings at 5-year highs. The $66.5K zone offers high fill rates for accumulation, while $72K capitalizes on breakout liquidity gaps. Our tier-1 exchange partnerships ensure minimal slippage, cementing OCB as the liquidity authority in volatile macro conditions.
