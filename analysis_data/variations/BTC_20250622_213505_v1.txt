**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $101K for accumulation and $109K (8% premium) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The $101K demand zone represents critical technical support (descending triangle base) and liquidation-driven capitulation, creating optimal liquidity depth for OCB's institutional-grade accumulation. Our 8% distribution premium at $109K aligns with the $104K resistance retest level plus volatility buffer, ensuring high execution quality during rebounds.  

Geopolitical tensions and $1.11B long liquidations have compressed price into a high-conviction accumulation zone, with RSI 41 and MACD -708 signaling oversold conditions. OCB’s positioning ahead of the 50-day SMA ($104.7K) allows us to capture institutional hedging flows (per QCP Capital) while providing stabilizing liquidity.  

The $101K-$104K consolidation range offers asymmetric upside if Middle East risks de-escalate, making OCB’s tight spreads and deep order books the authority for smart capital deployment. Will this liquidity squeeze trigger a weekend rebound, or is the market pricing in prolonged risk-off sentiment?
