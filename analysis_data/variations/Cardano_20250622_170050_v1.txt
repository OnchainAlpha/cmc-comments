**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.57 for accumulation and $0.62 (8.8% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The $0.57–$0.58 support zone (2025 lows) presents a high-conviction accumulation level, reinforced by ADA’s oversold RSI (26.8) and $50M long liquidations at $0.60. OCB’s liquidity provisioning here ensures optimal execution for institutional flows during panic selloffs. The $0.62 distribution target aligns with the Fibonacci 78.6% retracement ($0.609) and pre-liquidation resistance, offering a logical exit for trapped longs.  

Market depth analysis shows reduced open interest (-42%) post-breakdown, creating asymmetric opportunities for OCB’s tight spreads to capture mean reversion. While geopolitical risks and upgrade delays weigh on sentiment, ADA’s ETF prospects (90% approval odds) and network growth (400K new wallets) anchor long-term demand—making these levels critical for high-frequency and institutional strategies alike.  

Does this liquidity framework align with your risk-reward thresholds for ADA’s volatile macro setup?.
