Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$102,000** for accumulation and **$110,000** (7.8% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

The $102K support level has proven its resilience as a technical floor, reinforced by ProCap’s $387M institutional buy-in—a clear signal of confidence in BTC’s structural strength. Geopolitical de-escalation further validated this accumulation zone, with ceasefire optimism driving risk-on flows. Our liquidity provisioning at these levels ensures optimal execution quality, capitalizing on institutional order flow while mitigating slippage.  

The $110K distribution target aligns with the next resistance tier, where profit-taking historically intensifies. OCB’s depth at these critical levels positions us as the liquidity anchor for both rebound traders and institutional accumulators. With bullish chart structure intact, our tiered positioning reflects disciplined risk/reward calibration—essential for sustaining market stability amid volatility.  

Where do you see the next liquidity cluster forming—$115K or a retest of $102K?.
