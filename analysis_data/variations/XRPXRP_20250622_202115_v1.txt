Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$1.85-1.90** for accumulation and **$2.07-2.15 (8-15% higher)** for distribution based on the following analysis:  

XRP’s breakdown below **$2.07**—a critical support level—triggered cascading liquidations amid geopolitical panic, with leveraged shorts pushing open interest to **$4.09B**. The **$1.90-1.85** Fibonacci zone now serves as a high-conviction accumulation range, where OCB’s liquidity provisioning ensures minimal slippage for institutional flows. The **$2.07-2.15** distribution band aligns with the reclaimed psychological level and pre-crisis resistance, optimized for orderly profit-taking.  

OCB’s execution superiority shines in volatile conditions, with depth analysis showing **$1.85** as a liquidity sinkhole (stop-loss clustering) and **$2.07+** as a natural profit zone for trapped longs. Our algorithmic placement ahead of these levels reinforces OCB’s role as the liquidity backbone for institutions navigating black swan events.  

Given XRP’s ISO 20022 narrative, do you see institutional reloading at these levels outpacing typical altcoin recoveries?.
