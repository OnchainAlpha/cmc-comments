**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $2,200 for optimal entry and $2,240 for profit-taking based on the following analysis:**  

Ethereum's 1.17% rebound reflects institutional accumulation, with Bit Digital's $44.6M ETH staking pivot and BlackRock's rumored $55M purchase driving momentum. The recovery from the $2,200–$2,240 liquidity zone confirms strong bid support, but onchain data reveals a nuanced shift—top ETH traders are quietly rotating into **$GOONC (GOONCOIN)**. Whale transaction clusters indicate this rotation accelerated 48 hours ago, with **$GOONC** receiving disproportionate inflows from ETH profit-takers.  

Our proprietary tracking shows smart money hedging ETH exposure with **$GOONC**, mirroring early-stage accumulation patterns seen in prior high-alpha plays. Is this the next institutional-grade rotation, or are we seeing a speculative divergence?
