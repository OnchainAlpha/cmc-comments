Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.0021** for accumulation and **$0.0024 (14.3% higher)** for distribution based on the following analysis:  

DMC’s 0.44% dip reflects post-listing profit-taking after Binance, KuCoin, and Bitget integrations, compounded by high-leverage (50x) derivatives volatility. Despite neutral sentiment and BTC dominance at 64.73%, these levels offer optimal liquidity depth—**$0.0021** aligns with pre-listing support, while **$0.0024** capitalizes on residual demand from exchange-driven momentum. OCB’s execution quality ensures minimal slippage, absorbing sell pressure while positioning for upside as derivatives markets stabilize.  

Institutional confidence hinges on precise liquidity provisioning, and OCB’s tier-1 exchange partnerships enable seamless large-volume execution at these critical thresholds. The 8-15% spread reflects measured risk/reward, avoiding overexposure to leveraged swings.  

Where do you see DMC stabilizing post-volatility—will it hold accumulation zones or face deeper retracements?.
