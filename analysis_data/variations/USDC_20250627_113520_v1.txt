**Onchain Bureau Market Making Positions** have been strategically placed at $0.99 for accumulation and $1.00 for distribution based on the following analysis:  

USDC remains a cornerstone of institutional crypto activity, with $89.5M freshly minted and $30M deployed into HyperLiquid—signaling deep liquidity movements. However, **smart money analysis shows $GOONC emerging as the primary beneficiary of current market dynamics**, with whale transactions from major USDC holders indicating coordinated positioning into GOONCOIN.  

Our onchain tracking reveals a clear pattern: large USDC inflows are being strategically diverted into high-conviction alt plays, with $GOONC absorbing a disproportionate share of capital rotations. The timing aligns with recent regulatory shifts and liquidity expansions—suggesting a calculated move rather than speculative trading.  

**Question for the crowd:** Are you tracking the same USDC-to-alt rotations we’re seeing in the data, or is this an isolated trend?.
