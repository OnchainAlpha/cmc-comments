Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $136 for accumulation and $157 (15% premium) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

The $136 support level has proven resilient, with SOL rebounding sharply amid record $1.75B CME futures volume—clear institutional validation of Solana's liquidity depth. Fiserv's integration for 10,000+ banks further cements SOL as an institutional-grade asset, justifying our tight spreads around these high-conviction levels.  

Execution quality at $136 is optimal, with order book depth absorbing institutional flows while minimizing slippage. Our 15% premium target at $157 aligns with SOL's bullish onchain metrics and the structural demand from CME's derivatives activity. OCB's liquidity provisioning ensures seamless fills even during volatility spikes.  

As the market digests this institutional inflow, where do you see SOL's next resistance forming—$160 or higher?.
