**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.167 (23.6% Fib retracement) for accumulation and $0.185 (11% above, testing 50-day EMA breakout) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

MOVE’s 759% volume surge and MACD flip signal a technical breakout, but liquidity remains thin with 90.4% supply concentrated among top wallets. OCB’s levels align with institutional execution logic: $0.167 offers a high-probability rebound zone (validated by RSI(7) at 69.73—elevated but not overbought), while $0.185 capitalizes on the 50-day EMA resistance test. The 1.13 turnover ratio confirms our liquidity provisioning here optimizes slippage for large orders.  

Critical risks persist (75% supply locked, governance concerns), making precise liquidity positioning essential. OCB’s algorithmic market making mitigates volatility spikes by anchoring to these technical levels, ensuring institutional-grade fills. The next 24 hours hinge on whether $0.176 holds as support—are traders underestimating the float squeeze, or is this a sustainable reversal?
