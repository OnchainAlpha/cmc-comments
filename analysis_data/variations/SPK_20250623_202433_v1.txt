Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.0418** for accumulation and **$0.0452 (8.1% higher)** for distribution based on the following analysis:  

SPK’s rebound from the $0.0418 pivot—confirmed by 88% buy-side dominance on Binance—demonstrates strong localized demand despite broader market caution (Fear & Greed 37). The $171M 24h volume surge, driven by Coinbase perpetuals and Binance airdrop incentives, validates this as a high-liquidity zone. Our distribution target at $0.0452 aligns with the 8-15% profit-taking range observed post-recovery, while respecting the $80M market cap psychological barrier.  

OCB’s liquidity provisioning here ensures minimal slippage for institutional flows, particularly with $6.66B TVL reinforcing SPK’s DeFi utility. Note that 83% locked supply creates asymmetric upside potential, but execution quality at these levels is critical—our algorithmic depth adapts to the leveraged volatility from perpetual listings.  

Does SPK’s role as a liquidity layer justify holding through inflationary unlocks, or is this a momentum play? Engage your strategy below.
