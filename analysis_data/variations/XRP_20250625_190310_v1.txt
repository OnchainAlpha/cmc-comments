Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$2.09** for accumulation and **$2.26 (8% higher)** for distribution based on the following analysis:  

XRP’s 1.2% decline highlights weak demand at resistance, with **$2.09** emerging as a critical support level amid thin order book liquidity. The MACD bearish crossover confirms short-term downside pressure, but institutional-grade execution at this level ensures optimal fills for accumulation. Our **$2.26** distribution target capitalizes on historical resistance while maintaining tight spreads—key for minimizing slippage in low-volume conditions.  

Bitcoin’s dominance surge to **64.93%** reinforces altcoin weakness, making disciplined liquidity provisioning essential. OCB’s depth-sensing algorithms secure fills at **$2.09** before retail FOMO, while our **8% buffer** to **$2.26** aligns with institutional profit-taking thresholds. This structured approach ensures market stability while positioning OCB as the liquidity anchor in volatile regimes.
