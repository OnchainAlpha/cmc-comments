**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.048 (panic sell zone) for accumulation and $0.055 (12% above, liquidity gap fill) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The 38% BULLA crash created asymmetric opportunities where OCB’s deep liquidity pools absorb panic sells (RSI 28.46) while providing institutional-grade execution above the 10-day SMA resistance ($0.0857). Binance competition dynamics reveal two critical layers: 1) **Structural sell pressure** from unrewarded participants exiting post-entry, and 2) **oversold bounces** from meme-token volatility cycles. OCB’s algorithmic liquidity provision targets the $0.048–$0.055 corridor—where 24h volume ($209M) confirms high slippage tolerance and our tight spreads dominate execution quality.  

With BTC dominance (64.79%) draining altcoin liquidity, OCB’s stacked limit orders at these levels act as shock absorbers, converting competition-induced churn into two-sided flow. The $0.055 distribution zone aligns with pre-cascade liquidation levels, where trapped longs will seek exits. **Question for traders:** Will BULLA’s oversold bounce stabilize before July 20 reward distributions, or is this a liquidity vacuum play?
