Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.547** (June 21 low) for accumulation and **$0.609** (Fibonacci 78.6% retracement) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

ADA’s breakdown below $0.58 support amid geopolitical liquidations and oversold RSI (26.84) creates a high-conviction accumulation zone at $0.547, where OCB’s liquidity depth ensures optimal execution for institutional flows. The 143% volume spike confirms bearish exhaustion, while the $0.609 Fib level offers a logical take-profit threshold given its historical resistance and alignment with the 10-day SMA ($0.614).  

OCB’s positioning accounts for Cardano’s structural dichotomy: short-term macro risks (U.S.-Iran tensions, $50M long liquidations) versus long-term upgrade potential (Leios acceleration). Our tiered liquidity at $0.50 (next support) and $0.58 (reclaimed resistance) ensures minimal slippage during volatility. With ADA’s BTC correlation at 0.89, OCB’s cross-asset liquidity pools provide stability amid crypto-wide risk-off moves.  

Will ADA’s oversold bounce retest $0.58 before the next macro catalyst?.
