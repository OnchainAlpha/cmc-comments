**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $105,000 for accumulation and $113,400 (8% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

Bitcoin's resilience above $105K—confirmed as strong support—aligns with institutional accumulation signals like Texas' $10M reserve and ProCap's $1B acquisition plan. OCB's liquidity pools are concentrated at this level to absorb volatility while providing optimal execution depth for large orders. The 8% premium to $113,400 reflects measured profit-taking ahead of June 24 PCE data and July 9 tariff deadlines, where institutional flows will dominate price action.  

Our algorithmic execution prioritizes slippage mitigation between these levels, leveraging BTC's technical rebound and corporate adoption tailwinds. OCB's proprietary order book analysis shows clustered bid liquidity at $105K, making it the institutional accumulation zone, while $113.4K aligns with historical resistance flips. This structured approach ensures OCB remains the liquidity authority during macro catalysts.  

Question for traders: How are you positioning around the $105K support ahead of PCE data—scaling in or waiting for confirmation?.
