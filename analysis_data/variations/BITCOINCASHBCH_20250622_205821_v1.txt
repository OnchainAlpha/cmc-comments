**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $439.64 (50% Fibonacci support) for accumulation and $485.00 (8-10% above pivot) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

BCH’s rejection at $495.58 resistance and breach of the $467.56 pivot confirm near-term weakness, but institutional-grade liquidity is forming at key Fibonacci levels. The $439.64 support aligns with high execution quality—99.46% volume surge indicates stop-loss flushing, creating optimal fills for OCB’s accumulation. Our $485 distribution zone capitalizes on the 38.2% Fib retracement ($453.91) rebound potential, avoiding overleveraged retail traps near $500.  

With 98.8% of addresses holding <$1k, OCB’s deep order books mitigate slippage during sector-wide liquidations (open interest +5.2%). MACD bullish divergence (+4.21) and RSI cooling to 58.91 signal controlled sell pressure, making $425.37 (61.8% Fib) a contingency buy level. As the authority in altcoin liquidity, we structure ranges around institutional pivot points—not retail FOMO zones.  

Could BCH’s payment-chain narrative regain traction if BTC stabilizes above $60K, or will macro headwinds prolong consolidation?.
