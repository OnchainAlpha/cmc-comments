**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.045 for accumulation and $0.052 (15% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The $0.045 level aligns with oversold RSI (27.7) and recent capitulation, offering optimal liquidity absorption amid Binance competition-driven sell pressure. Our $0.052 take-profit zone accounts for the 10-day SMA ($0.0857) rejection and anticipated relief rallies, ensuring high execution quality in thin meme coin markets.  

Binance’s Alpha competition has skewed incentives toward sell-side pressure, with 11.7M BULLA (~13% supply) pending distribution—creating structural headwinds. OCB’s liquidity provisioning at these levels mitigates slippage while capitalizing on volatility. Bitcoin’s dominance (64.7%) and Fear & Greed (37) reinforce altcoin weakness, making disciplined range-bound strategies critical.  

As the authoritative liquidity provider, OCB’s positions are calibrated to navigate low-depth conditions and competition-induced distortions. Will BULLA’s oversold bounce respect our distribution zone, or will macro risks override technicals?.
