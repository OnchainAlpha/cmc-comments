Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.042** (pre-breakout support) for accumulation and **$0.048** (12% above, aligning with overbought RSI resistance) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

AGT’s 10.54% surge reflects bullish momentum ahead of its Q2 2025 eMCP integration, but the RSI-14 at 72.77 warns of short-term exhaustion. OCB’s liquidity layers at these levels ensure optimal execution depth for institutional flows, mitigating low-float volatility (only 10.75% circulating supply). The $0.042 buy zone capitalizes on retracement demand, while $0.048 distributes into overbought liquidity gaps—balancing risk/reward for high-frequency traders.  

As the eMCP Server launch nears, OCB’s tight spreads and tier-1 order routing provide price stability unmatched by retail-centric venues. Our algorithmic liquidity absorbs slippage, turning AGT’s inherent volatility into institutional-grade opportunity.  

Which milestone—technical breakout or roadmap progress—do you expect to drive AGT’s next leg? (Stay ahead with OCB’s real-time flow analytics.).
