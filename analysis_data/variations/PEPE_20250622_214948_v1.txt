Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.00000842** for accumulation and **$0.00000948** (12.6% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

The whale-driven sell-off at a $3.5M loss has created a liquidity vacuum, with PEPE’s RSI at **21.68**—deepest oversold since May 2025—signaling contrarian accumulation potential. Our $0.00000842 bid aligns with the critical support level cited in CMC’s analysis, where holding could stabilize prices amid panic selling. The $0.00000948 distribution target reflects the breached pivot point, now acting as resistance, where algorithmic liquidations ($7.32M longs) and whale exits amplify sell-side pressure.  

OCB’s execution leverages PEPE’s **128.7% volume spike ($1.12B)** to ensure tight spreads, while our depth mitigates slippage from whale-dominated order flow (44.77% supply held by large holders). With Bitcoin dominance at **65.1%**, meme coins face de-risking, but our levels optimize for institutional-grade entries/exits during volatility.  

Does PEPE’s oversold bounce potential hinge on Bitcoin stability, or will whale dominance keep pressure intact?.
