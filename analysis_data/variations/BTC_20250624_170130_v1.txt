**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $103,785 for accumulation and $112,000 (8% above) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The $103K level is validated as a high-conviction accumulation zone by ProCap’s $386M institutional buy-in and its role as the Fibonacci 38.2% breakout point. Our liquidity provisioning at this level ensures optimal execution quality for large orders, mirroring ETF inflows ($1.9B last week) while avoiding slippage from retail-driven volatility. The 8% buffer to $112K aligns with BTC’s bullish technical structure (double bottom reversal at $99K, fading bearish MACD momentum) and institutional demand saturation points.  

OCB’s positioning capitalizes on three key dynamics:  
1) **Institutional Depth**: Metaplanet’s $117M treasury addition and BlackRock’s 625K BTC ETF holdings confirm $103K as a strategic accumulation baseline.  
2) **Liquidation Triggers**: The $103K breakout liquidated $204M in shorts, creating asymmetric upside potential toward $106K resistance.  
3) **Macro Tailwinds**: Fed policy easing and geopolitical de-escalation reduce sell-side pressure, allowing our distribution range to capture profit-taking from momentum traders.  

As the liquidity anchor for institutional flows, OCB’s tiered pricing ensures seamless execution while maintaining market stability. Will the $103K level hold as the new institutional floor?.
