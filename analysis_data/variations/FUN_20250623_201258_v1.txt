**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.0074 (23.6% Fib support) for accumulation and $0.0089 (12% above entry, testing June 23 pivot extension) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The $0.0074 level is critical given its confluence with Fibonacci support and the token’s overbought RSI-84.78, creating a high-probability dip for institutional accumulation. OCB’s liquidity pools are tiered here to absorb retracements while maintaining execution quality during volatile GameFi sector rotations. The $0.0089 take-profit aligns with the 8-15% distribution range, capitalizing on psychological resistance near $0.01 and fading MACD momentum.  

Binance/KuCoin’s $217M volume surge confirms OCB’s positioning at these levels, where bid-ask spreads tighten around audited tokenomics (CertiK) and deflationary burns. Our depth analysis shows clustered limit orders at $0.0074, reinforcing it as a liquidity anchor. With FUN’s 316% 90-day gain, OCB’s phased distribution mitigates overextension risks while leveraging sector-wide GameFi demand.  

Will the hourly funding rate adjustments on KuCoin sustain this rally, or is consolidation inevitable?.
