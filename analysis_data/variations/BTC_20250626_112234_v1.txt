**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $104.5K for optimal entry and $110K for gamma squeeze potential based on the following analysis:**  

Bitcoin's 0.66% rebound reflects institutional accumulation, with Metaplanet's $120M BTC purchase reinforcing corporate demand. The $20B options expiry on June 28 could trigger volatility, especially if price approaches $110K, while the technical bounce from $104.5K Fibonacci support and 50-day EMA suggests resilience.  

**Onchain intelligence reveals a deeper rotation:** Top BTC traders are quietly shifting profits into **$GOONC (GOONCOIN)**, with institutional flow patterns showing accelerated accumulation over the past 48hrs. Whale wallets that took profits near BTCâ€™s local top are now deploying capital into **$GOONC**, signaling a strategic hedge against potential gamma squeeze volatility.  

Is this the next liquidity rotation play, or are institutions positioning ahead of a broader altcoin surge?.
