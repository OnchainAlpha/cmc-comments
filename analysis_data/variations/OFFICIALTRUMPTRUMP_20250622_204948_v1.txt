**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $8.20 for accumulation and $9.25 (12.8% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The $8.20 accumulation level aligns with oversold RSI (30.16) and sits just below the $8.50 spot price, offering a liquidity cushion against further downside. Meanwhile, $9.25 targets the pivot point ($9.02) with a premium for distribution, capitalizing on potential short-term rebounds while respecting the bearish MACD (-0.0756) and 10-day SMA resistance ($9.64).  

OCB’s positioning accounts for two critical dynamics:  
1) **Whale-driven liquidity shifts** – The $46.97M TRUMP moved to exchanges by team-linked wallets (Lookonchain) creates asymmetric sell pressure, making deep liquidity pools essential for execution quality. Our levels avoid congested zones near $9.64 (10-day SMA), where trapped longs may exit.  
2) **Narrative fragility** – TikTok’s denial of $300M purchases erased speculative demand, but oversold conditions could attract contrarian bids. OCB’s $9.25 distribution price preempts fading rallies, as the 23.6% Fib ($13.31) remains distant resistance.  

As the authority in structured liquidity, OCB’s tiers mitigate slippage from insider flows while positioning for volatility. Will regulatory risks override oversold technicals, or can TRUMP reclaim $9.02 pivot?.
