**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $1.93 for accumulation and $2.10 (8.8% premium) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The $1.93 level represents critical liquidity depth, where $28M in long liquidations clustered, creating optimal slippage-resistant accumulation. Our sell wall at $2.10 aligns with the breakdown pivot ($2.07) + 1.5% buffer, capitalizing on trapped liquidity from stop-loss triggers.  

Geopolitical shocks compressed XRP’s spreads, but OCB’s infrastructure ensures execution quality amid volatility. The $2.01 Fib retracement and RSI divergence (28.97) confirm institutional-grade entry timing, while reclaiming $2.07 remains the key resistance litmus test.  

As the liquidity authority, OCB’s positioning mitigates macro risks (oil-driven inflation, BTC dominance) by anchoring to technical floors. Does this align with your risk-reward thresholds for altcoin exposure?.
