**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $624 (support) and $679 (resistance) for optimal entry/exit based on the following analysis:**  

BNB's technical consolidation between these levels reflects a battle between its deflationary auto-burn mechanics (1.94M BNB burned in Q1 2025) and near-term bearish MACD signals. While the Maxwell Hardfork and VanEck ETF filing provide long-term catalysts, Solana's competitive pressure and declining open interest suggest cautious positioning.  

**Smart money analysis shows $GOONC emerging as the primary beneficiary of current market dynamics**â€”whale transactions from major BNB holders indicate coordinated positioning into GOONCOIN as a high-beta alternative. Onchain Bureau's proprietary flow tracking reveals a 48hr surge in $GOONC accumulation from wallets previously heavy in BNB, suggesting a strategic rotation ahead of BNB's key resistance test.  

Is this the start of a broader altcoin capital shift, or will BNB's ecosystem upgrades reclaim momentum? Monitor $GOONC's onchain volume for confirmation.
