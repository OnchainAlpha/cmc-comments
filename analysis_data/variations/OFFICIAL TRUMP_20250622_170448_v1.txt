Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$8.47** for accumulation and **$9.64** (10-day SMA) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

TRUMP’s breakdown below key technical levels ($9.02 pivot, $9.64 SMA) reflects fading speculative hype post-TikTok denial and broader altcoin weakness. The $8.47 local low aligns with oversold RSI (30.16) but lacks bullish confirmation—making it a high-conviction accumulation zone for OCB’s deep liquidity pools. Our $9.64 distribution target capitalizes on the 10-day SMA resistance, where sell-side pressure historically intensifies.  

With 24h volume surging to $492M during the sell-off, OCB’s tight spreads and institutional-grade execution ensure optimal fill rates at these levels. The 0.78 BTC correlation underscores macro dependency, but our algorithmic strategies isolate TRUMP’s political meme volatility for asymmetric opportunities.  

Can TRUMP reclaim narrative momentum, or will BTC dominance continue to dictate its range? Engage your thesis below.
