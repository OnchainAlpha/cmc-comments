Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $2,380 for accumulation and $2,570 (8% premium) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

The failed $2,600 breakout created immediate technical resistance, while $11.3M in ETF outflows amplified selling pressure. Our liquidity depth analysis shows strong institutional bids forming at $2,380—a key psychological level where leveraged longs were liquidated. The 8% spread to our distribution target accounts for both overhead resistance at $2,570 and the market-wide risk-off sentiment from geopolitical tensions.  

OCB’s execution algorithms are actively providing two-sided liquidity at these levels, ensuring minimal slippage for large orders. The $2,380 accumulation zone represents a high-conviction re-entry point for smart money, as weaker hands have been flushed out. Our proprietary flow data confirms taker buy volume increasing at this level despite broader market hesitancy.  

Where are you positioning for ETH’s next move—scaling into weakness or waiting for confirmation above $2,500?.
