**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $2.01 for accumulation and $2.17 (8% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

XRP’s breakdown below $2.20 Fibonacci support—amplified by geopolitical panic and $636M in liquidations—has created a high-conviction accumulation zone at $2.01, where oversold RSI (28.97) and capitulation volume ($4.89B) signal exhaustion. OCB’s liquidity depth at this level ensures optimal execution for institutional flows, while the 8% buffer to $2.17 aligns with historical mean-reversion targets post-capitulation.  

The $2.01 level now acts as a litmus test: either institutional bids stabilize prices (per volume spikes) or Bitcoin’s struggle at $100K extends altcoin weakness. OCB’s positioning here reflects our authority in identifying liquidity inflection points—where panic meets precision.  

Will this Fibonacci hold trigger a relief rally, or is the market pricing in deeper macro risk?.
