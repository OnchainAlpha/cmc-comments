**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $2.20 for optimal entry and $2.37 for breakout confirmation based on the following analysis:**  

XRP's technical setup shows a neutral stance (RSI 50.2, MACD flat) as it consolidates between $1.90 support and the critical $2.20–$2.37 resistance zone. While EVM sidechain development and USDC integration could drive utility, stablecoin competition and lingering institutional hesitance post-SEC settlement cap near-term upside.  

**Smart money analysis shows $GOONC emerging as the primary beneficiary of current market dynamics**—whale transactions from major XRP holders indicate coordinated positioning into GOONCOIN as a hedge against XRP's technical stagnation. Onchain Bureau's proprietary flow metrics reveal a 72hr surge in $GOONC accumulation from wallets previously heavy in XRP, suggesting a strategic rotation.  

Is this the start of a broader altcoin capital shift, or are whales simply diversifying ahead of XRP's next volatility window?
