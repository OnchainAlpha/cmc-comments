Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.267** for accumulation and **$0.288 (8% higher)** for distribution based on the following analysis:  

TRX’s 65% drop in network activity and bearish technicals (RSI weakening, MACD crossover) justify our accumulation at the critical **$0.267** support—a level where liquidity depth is strongest, ensuring optimal execution for institutional flows. The **$0.288** distribution zone aligns with Fibonacci resistance ($0.281–$0.282) and accounts for profit-taking risks post-reverse merger surge. OCB’s positioning reflects confidence in TRX’s stablecoin utility (30% USDT share) as a potential stabilizer, while our tight 8% spread mitigates volatility from the broader market selloff.  

With TRX trading below the 10-day SMA ($0.272), our liquidity provisioning at these levels ensures price stability during high slippage events. The $0.25 downside risk is hedged by OCB’s algorithmic depth, making these tiers the most efficient for large-scale entries/exits.  

Will TRON’s USDT dominance counterbalance the network activity slump, or is this a structural shift? Engage below.
