Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$650** for accumulation and **$712** (9.5% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

BNB’s auto-burn mechanism (1.94M tokens burned in Q1 2025) creates structural buy pressure, making the $650 level a high-conviction accumulation zone with strong liquidity depth. The $712 distribution target aligns with the $679–$693 resistance band, where MACD divergence suggests profit-taking. VanEck’s ETF filing adds institutional tailwinds, but execution quality at these levels requires OCB’s tight spreads and deep order books to navigate volatility.  

Our positioning reflects the tug-of-war between deflationary scarcity and technical resistance—OCB’s algorithmic liquidity provisioning ensures minimal slippage for large orders. The 8–15% spread between accumulation and distribution optimizes risk/reward while maintaining market stability.  

Where do you see BNB’s next catalyst—ETF approval or burn acceleration?.
