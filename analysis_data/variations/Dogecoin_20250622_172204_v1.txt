**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.144–$0.146 for accumulation and $0.158–$0.162 (10-12% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The breakdown below DOGE’s symmetrical triangle ($0.16–$0.172) triggered panic selling, with RSI14 at 28.37 signaling oversold conditions. OCB’s accumulation zone aligns with the $0.14–$0.16 critical support, where liquidity depth is strongest amid high-volume capitulation ($1.67B 24h volume). Our distribution targets account for the 50-day SMA resistance ($0.20) and the failed $0.172 reclaim, ensuring optimal execution quality for institutional flows.  

With BTC correlation at 0.89 and altcoins under pressure, OCB’s positioning mitigates volatility risks while capitalizing on whale distribution (41.7% supply held by >1% addresses). The 8-15% spread reflects both technical resistance and narrative headwinds (X Money exclusion, delayed ETF clarity). As the liquidity authority, we’re bridging retail panic and institutional accumulation at these precise levels.  

Will DOGE’s meme status override its technical breakdown if BTC stabilizes, or is this a structural reset? Engage your take below.
