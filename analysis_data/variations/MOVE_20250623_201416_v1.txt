**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.1325–$0.136 for accumulation and $0.1697–$0.182 (8-15% premium) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The breakout above $0.1325–$0.136 resistance (validated by 758% volume surge) confirms a structural shift, with the 23.6% Fib ($0.1697) now acting as support—a critical inflection point for institutional execution. OCB’s liquidity provisioning at these levels ensures optimal fill rates during volatile, low-float conditions, where 90% supply concentration demands precision.  

The rebound from oversold RSI 29.35 and MACD bullish divergence (-0.00177) signals momentum, but the 50-day SMA ($0.164) and thin order books require disciplined liquidity management. OCB’s algorithmic depth at $0.128 (78.6% Fib support) and $0.1697 mitigates slippage risks while capitalizing on speculative inflows.  

**Question for traders:** How are you navigating MOVE’s liquidity constraints—scaling into strength or waiting for a retest of $0.136?.
