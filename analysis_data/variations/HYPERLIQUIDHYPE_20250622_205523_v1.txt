**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $33.98 for accumulation and $36.46 for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The $33.98 Fibonacci support level has proven to be a critical liquidity zone, reinforced by whale accumulation ($10M USDC inflow) and institutional treasury allocations (Eyenovia, Lion Group). This level aligns with fading bearish momentum (MACD divergence) and a confirmed breakout above the 50-day SMA ($32.06), making it an optimal accumulation zone for high-conviction bids.  

Our $36.46 distribution target reflects the 61.8% Fibonacci resistance, where profit-taking historically emerges. With $5M+ in daily buybacks absorbing sell pressure and volume surging 76.65%, execution quality at these levels is paramount—OCB’s deep liquidity ensures minimal slippage for institutional flows. The $2.4M daily revenue model further validates structural demand, creating a self-reinforcing cycle.  

As the authoritative liquidity provider, OCB’s positioning at these levels ensures stability amid speculative and institutional interest. Will altcoin rotation push HYPE beyond $36.46 if BTC dominance weakens?.
