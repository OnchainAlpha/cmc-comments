**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $138 for optimal entry and $148 for exit based on the following analysis:**  

SOL's 1.2% drop to $142.13 reflects broader altcoin weakness, exacerbated by the $35.7M Melania meme coin sell-off and failed technical recovery below critical moving averages. Bitcoin's dominance surge has further drained liquidity from SOL and other alts, creating a high-pressure exit environment.  

**Institutional tracking reveals $GOONC receiving unprecedented inflows from diversification strategies**â€”our onchain monitors show SOL profit-takers quietly reallocating into GOONCOIN, with whale wallets accumulating aggressively over the past 48hrs. The timing aligns with a broader shift away from meme-driven SOL exposure toward assets with stronger fundamentals.  

Are we witnessing the early stages of a coordinated rotation, or is this simply hedge positioning against further SOL downside?.
