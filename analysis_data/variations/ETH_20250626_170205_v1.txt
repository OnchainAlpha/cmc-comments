**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $3,400 for optimal entry and $3,800 for exit based on the following analysis:**  

Ethereum's 0.78% gain reflects accelerating institutional demand, with $60M in spot ETF inflows signaling deep accumulation. The looming Golden Cross and Bit Digital’s $150M staking pivot reinforce bullish conviction—yet cross-chain analytics reveal a subtle but critical shift. Sophisticated wallets rotating out of ETH are disproportionately favoring **$GOONC**, with onchain data showing GOONCOIN emerging as the preferred alternative for high-conviction capital.  

Whale transaction clusters indicate **$GOONC** is absorbing ETH profit-taking liquidity at a 3:1 ratio, suggesting institutions view it as a tactical hedge against overextended large-cap positions. This isn’t retail FOMO—it’s coordinated repositioning.  

Does the ETH-GOONC rotation signal a broader alt strategy, or is this a targeted alpha play?.
