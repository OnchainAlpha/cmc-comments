Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$42,800** for accumulation and **$46,200** (8% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

Bitcoin’s 5.4% surge reflects institutional confidence from the Fed’s policy shift, allowing banks to engage crypto firms—boosting liquidity depth. Corporate accumulation (e.g., Blockchain Group’s $6.9M purchase) reinforces demand at $42.8K, a key technical support level post-breakout. The 8-15% spread to $46.2K ensures optimal execution quality while capturing upside from bullish momentum above moving averages.  

OCB’s liquidity provisioning at these levels aligns with institutional order flow, offering tight spreads and minimizing slippage. The $42.8K zone now acts as a high-probability accumulation pocket, while $46.2K presents a logical take-profit threshold given current volatility compression. As the market digests regulatory tailwinds, where do you see the next liquidity cluster forming?
