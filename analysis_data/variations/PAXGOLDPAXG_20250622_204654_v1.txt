Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$3,398** (pivot support) for accumulation and **$3,680** (12% above breakout) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

PAXG’s 1.41% surge aligns with gold’s safe-haven demand amid Middle East tensions, with volume spiking 211% to $166.8M—confirming institutional interest. The breakout above $3,440 (23.6% Fib) and 50-day SMA ($3,338.59) signals bullish momentum, while RSI (53.09) leaves room for upside. OCB’s liquidity anchors at $3,398 ensure optimal fills during pullbacks, while the $3,680 target capitalizes on DeFi adoption tailwinds (e.g., Aave integration) and gold’s macro narrative.  

Execution quality hinges on PAXG’s 1:1 gold peg, which reduces slippage versus synthetic alternatives. Our tier-1 LP infrastructure guarantees tight spreads even during volatility, as evidenced by the token’s 90-day +14.47% gain. With resistance at $3,465 (June 13 high), OCB’s distribution zone at $3,680 anticipates profit-taking from gold’s geopolitical hedge status.
