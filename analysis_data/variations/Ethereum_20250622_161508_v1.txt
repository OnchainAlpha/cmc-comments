**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $2,222.81 for accumulation and $2,399.84 (8% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

Ethereumâ€™s breakdown below the 78.6% Fib retracement ($2,362.94) confirms bearish momentum, but the June swing low at **$2,222.81** presents a high-conviction accumulation zoneâ€”validated by oversold RSI (21.18) and panic-driven liquidity. Our distribution target at **$2,399.84** aligns with the 50% retracement of the recent drop, where ETF outflows ($11.3M) and MACD divergence (-45.75) may cap relief rallies.  

OCBâ€™s liquidity provisioning at these levels ensures optimal execution depth amid volatile volumes ($27.7B, +48.7%). Institutional retreat (BlackRockâ€™s $19.7M outflow) demands precision, which our algorithmic strategies deliver by anchoring to technical supports while preempting geopolitical-driven squeezes.  

With ETH/BTC at 0.02 and Bitcoin dominance rising, does this dip present a contrarian entryâ€”or will macro risks prolong the altcoin winter?.
