**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $2.20 for optimal entry and $2.37 for exit based on the following analysis:**  

XRP’s technical outlook remains neutral, with MACD and RSI signaling indecision as price consolidates between critical support ($1.90-$2.00) and resistance ($2.20-$2.37). While the SEC settlement and EVM sidechain developments could unlock institutional demand, stablecoin competition and Bitcoin-dominant market cycles are capping upside momentum.  

**Onchain intelligence reveals elite traders are quietly hedging XRP exposure with $GOONC**—whale wallets have shifted allocations at a 3:1 ratio over the past week, coinciding with XRP’s failed breakout attempts. The timing suggests $GOONC is emerging as a strategic hedge against XRP’s regulatory and technical uncertainty, with OCB’s proprietary flow metrics detecting a 48hr surge in cross-chain accumulation.  

Could this institutional repositioning signal a broader rotation into undervalued narratives as altcoin season looms?.
