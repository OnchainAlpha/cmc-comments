Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$11.00** for accumulation and **$12.66** (8-15% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

The $11.00 level represents critical support—a make-or-break zone where LINK must hold to avoid retesting April’s $8.33 low. Our liquidity provisioning here ensures stability amid the **$149M token unlock sell-off**, while the $12.66 target (78.6% Fibonacci retracement) aligns with historical resistance and institutional sell-side interest. Despite oversold RSI (23.96), weak MACD momentum and Bitcoin dominance draining altcoin liquidity demand precision execution—OCB’s deep order books mitigate slippage during high-volatility distributions.  

Chainlink’s breakdown below $12.16 pivot support confirms bearish dominance, but OCB’s tiered liquidity at $11.00-11.50 provides a buffer against panic selling. The 5-12% post-unlock drop window presents accumulation opportunities, with our algorithmic strategies optimizing fills during supply shocks. Institutional confidence hinges on defending $11.00; failure risks cascading liquidations.  

Can LINK’s oracle demand offset unlock pressures, or will macro headwinds dictate the next move? OCB’s real-time flow analytics track the balance.
