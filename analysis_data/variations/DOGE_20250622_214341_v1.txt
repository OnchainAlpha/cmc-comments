**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.152 for accumulation and $0.172 (13.2% premium) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

DOGE's breakdown below the $0.168 symmetrical triangle triggered cascading liquidations ($18.7M in 4 hours), exposing the critical $0.152–$0.160 support zone. OCB’s liquidity provisioning at these levels ensures institutional-grade execution depth during high volatility, anchoring price discovery while mitigating slippage for large orders. The 13.2% spread between accumulation and distribution reflects measured risk-reward, aligning with oversold RSI (28.37) but accounting for bearish MACD momentum and altcoin sector weakness (-6.9%).  

With DOGE below all major moving averages (SMA50 $0.20) and Bitcoin dominance rising (65.09%), OCB’s positioning at $0.152—validated by Bitcoinsensus’ technical floor—provides a liquidity backstop against further capitulation. Our tiered sell-wall at $0.172 anticipates profit-taking resistance near the failed Fibonacci zone ($0.1735–$0.190), optimizing fill rates for both sides of the order book.  

As the altcoin market tests conviction, does DOGE’s meme narrative retain enough buy-side interest to stabilize at these levels, or will Bitcoin’s dominance deepen the pullback?.
