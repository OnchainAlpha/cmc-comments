Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.0418** for accumulation and **$0.0451 (8% higher)** for distribution based on the following analysis:  

SPK’s rebound from the $0.0418 pivot—confirmed by 88% buy-side dominance on Binance—demonstrates strong localized demand despite broader market caution (Fear & Greed: 37). The $171M 24h volume surge, fueled by Coinbase perpetuals and Binance airdrop incentives, validates this as a high-liquidity zone. OCB’s placement at this level ensures optimal execution quality, capitalizing on the technical recovery while mitigating slippage in volatile conditions.  

The $80M market cap milestone and $6.66B TVL underscore SPK’s DeFi utility, but 83% locked supply introduces inflationary risk. Our distribution target at $0.0451 aligns with the 8-15% profit-taking range observed post-airdrop, balancing protocol momentum with sell pressure. As the liquidity authority, OCB’s positions are calibrated to absorb retail flows while providing institutional-grade depth.  

Will SPK sustain demand above $0.0451, or will locked supply dilution cap upside?.
