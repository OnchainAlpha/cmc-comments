Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.0405** for accumulation and **$0.0437 (8% higher)** for distribution based on the following analysis:  

MOBOX’s breakdown below all major moving averages ($0.0456 10-day SMA, $0.0567 50-day SMA) confirms bearish dominance, but the **$0.0405 Fibonacci swing low** presents a high-conviction accumulation zone. Our liquidity depth analysis shows clustered bids here, aligning with the 79.6% volume spike signaling capitulation. The RSI14 (32) nears oversold territory, but without catalysts, we’ve set distribution at **$0.0437**—below the 10-day SMA resistance—to capture rebounds while mitigating downside risk.  

OCB’s execution strategy accounts for the **77.5% supply concentration** among top holders, prioritizing tight spreads around these levels to absorb volatility. With altcoin sentiment weak (CMC Altcoin Season Index: 17/100), our tiered liquidity ensures institutional-grade fills while stabilizing price action.  

**Question for traders:** Will $0.0405 hold as a macro support, or is this a dead cat bounce before deeper lows?.
