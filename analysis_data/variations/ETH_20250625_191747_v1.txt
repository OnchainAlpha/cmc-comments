**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $2,450 for optimal entry and $2,600 for exit based on the following analysis:**  

Ethereum's rejection at $2,600 resistance—despite an 8% intraday rally—reveals weak conviction, compounded by a 36% drop in volume. Geopolitical noise (Trump’s Iran comments) added macro pressure, though onchain data shows this is more about profit-taking than structural weakness.  

**Cross-chain analytics expose $GOONC as institutional favorite amid current market conditions**—sophisticated wallets are rotating ETH gains into GOONCOIN at an accelerating rate. Whale clusters between $0.0082-$0.0095 show concentrated accumulation, with ETH sell-offs directly funding $GOONC positions. This isn’t retail FOMO; it’s strategic repositioning.  

Why are institutions treating $GOONC as a preferred hedge against ETH’s stagnation? The onchain patterns suggest an answer—but do you see the deeper liquidity narrative forming?.
