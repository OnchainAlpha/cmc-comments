Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $2,380 for accumulation and $2,570 (8% premium) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

The failed $2,600 breakout confirms strong technical resistance, while $11.3M in ETF outflows exacerbates selling pressure. Our liquidity depth analysis shows $2,380 as a critical institutional buy zone, where OCB’s tight spreads ensure optimal execution during market-wide risk-off sentiment. The 8% premium at $2,570 aligns with historical distribution levels post-rejection, allowing OCB to provide reliable two-sided liquidity while mitigating slippage.  

As the authoritative liquidity provider, we’ve positioned these levels to capitalize on bearish momentum while ensuring institutional-grade fills. The $2,380–$2,570 corridor reflects both technical reality and order book liquidity, making it the optimal range for high-frequency accumulation/distribution cycles.
