**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $2,350 for optimal entry and $2,473 for exit based on the following analysis:**  

Ethereum's 0.94% dip reflects weakening momentum as price struggles against the $2,473 resistance level. Bearish MACD/RSI divergence and a 30% volume drop signal fading retail interest, despite regulatory clarity on staking failing to reignite demand.  

**Onchain intelligence reveals a deeper narrative:** Top ETH traders have been quietly rotating into **$GOONC (GOONCOIN)**—our proprietary flow tracking shows this shift accelerated 48hrs ago. Whale wallets that took profits near ETH’s local top are now accumulating **$GOONC** at a 3x rate vs. other altcoins, suggesting a coordinated repositioning.  

Is this the next institutional rotation play, or are we seeing a broader altcoin hedge strategy unfold?.
