Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$625.72** (200-day EMA support) for accumulation and **$685** (8% above buy zone, pre-breakdown resistance) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

BNB’s breakdown below the $668.69 Fibonacci level confirms bearish momentum, with descending triangle targeting $585 if $624 fails. The 200-day EMA at $625.72 represents institutional-grade liquidity, where OCB’s deep order books ensure optimal execution during volatile cascades. Our sell zone at $685 aligns with pre-breakdown resistance, capitalizing on relief rallies amid high-volume distribution ($1.93B 24h turnover).  

The HAI exploit and sector-wide 5.7% drop amplified selling pressure, but BNB’s $52B DApp ecosystem underpins long-term demand. OCB’s tier-1 liquidity provisioning mitigates slippage risks during MACD-confirmed bear cycles (-3.36 histogram). With Maxwell upgrade’s mainnet launch imminent, will $625.72 hold as the institutional accumulation floor?
