**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $126.83 for accumulation and $140.00 (10.4% premium) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

Solana’s rebound from the critical $126.83 Fibonacci support—validated by 23.56% volume growth and improving MACD momentum—signals strong institutional accumulation. OCB’s liquidity provisioning at this level ensures optimal execution depth for large orders, particularly with $4B family offices entering Solana-adjacent strategies. The $140 distribution zone aligns with resistance-turned-support confirmation, where profit-taking from retail and $61M in weekly unlocks may test bullish resolve.  

Geopolitical tailwinds and altcoin rotation have amplified SOL’s beta advantage, but OCB’s tier-1 liquidity infrastructure mitigates slippage during volatile surges. With VMS Group’s $10M DeFi allocation and 9GAG’s public SOL purchase reinforcing institutional conviction, our tight spreads at key levels provide unmatched fill reliability.  

Will SOL’s hold above $140 validate this as a breakout, or will unlocks trigger a retest of $126.83? **Pro traders: How are you positioning around these levels?**.
