Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.00000948** (breached pivot support) for accumulation and **$0.0000105** (11% above, aligning with oversold RSI rebound potential) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

The whale-driven sell-off and breakdown below the 50-day EMA ($0.0000119) have created a liquidity vacuum, with weak volume confirming limited organic bids. OCB’s accumulation at $0.00000948 targets algorithmic sell orders triggered by the support breach, while our distribution zone capitalizes on any RSI-driven retracement. The MACD’s bearish crossover and $3.5M in liquidations underscore the need for precision—our tiers are calibrated to absorb panic sells and provide institutional-grade execution during volatile rotations.  

With Bitcoin dominance squeezing altcoin liquidity, OCB’s stacked orders at these levels ensure price stability while positioning as the authoritative liquidity provider. The oversold RSI (21.7) may invite speculative bids, but weak market depth demands structured exits. Will PEPE’s meme appeal outweigh the technical damage, or is this a liquidity trap for overeager dip buyers?.
