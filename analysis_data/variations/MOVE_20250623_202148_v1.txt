Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$0.1325–$0.136** (confirmed breakout zone) for accumulation and **$0.164–$0.1697** (50-day SMA + 23.6% Fib) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

MOVE’s 40% surge reflects a technical breakout from oversold conditions, but liquidity depth remains thin—758% volume spikes indicate speculative froth. OCB’s positioning anchors critical levels: the **$0.128–$0.136** support band (78.6% Fib + breakout zone) for high-probability accumulation, while the **$0.164–$0.1697** resistance cluster (50-day SMA + Fib flip) offers optimal distribution into strength. Institutional execution hinges on these technical milestones, as MACD momentum and RSI reversals validate the ranges.  

With 90% supply concentration, OCB’s liquidity provision mitigates slippage risks during volatile mean-reversion plays. The 24-hour turnover ratio (0.795) signals dependency on tight spreads—our algorithmic depth ensures fills at derived levels while retail chases illiquid pumps.  

Will MOVE sustain above $0.1697 to confirm trend reversal, or will thin liquidity trigger a retest of breakout support?.
