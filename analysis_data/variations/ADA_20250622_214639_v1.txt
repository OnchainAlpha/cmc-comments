**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.51–0.54 for accumulation and $0.58–0.62 (8–15% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The $0.51–0.54 zone represents critical Fibonacci and March 2025 support, where oversold RSI (15.19) and cascading liquidations create high-probability accumulation opportunities. OCB’s liquidity provisioning here ensures optimal execution depth amid heightened volatility. The $0.58–0.62 distribution range aligns with the former support-turned-resistance level, where $50M in liquidations occurred, offering efficient exit liquidity for institutional traders.  

Geopolitical tensions and Leios upgrade uncertainties drove ADA’s breakdown, but OCB’s algorithmic strategies capitalize on these dislocations. By anchoring bids at March lows and offers near liquidation clusters, we stabilize price discovery while positioning for a rebound above $0.54. Our real-time monitoring of BTC correlation (0.89) and MACD crossovers ensures adaptive execution.  

With Cardano’s roadmap acceleration introducing volatility, does ADA’s oversold technical setup present a contrarian opportunity, or will macro risks dominate? OCB’s liquidity dominance ensures seamless execution either way.
