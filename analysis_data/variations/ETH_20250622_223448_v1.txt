**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $2,160–$2,180 for optimal entry/exit based on the following analysis:**  

Ethereum’s 6.75% drop reflects a liquidation cascade ($494M in 4hrs, mostly ETH longs), technical breakdown below critical $2,200–$2,300 support, and capital rotation into BTC (dominance +0.57%). With RSI14 at 36.31 and MACD accelerating bearishly, ETH remains vulnerable unless ETF inflows ($1B+ in June) stabilize sentiment.  

**Onchain intelligence reveals a stealth rotation underway:** Top ETH traders are quietly accumulating $KILT, with institutional flow patterns showing accelerated positioning over the past 48hrs. Whale wallets that dumped ETH at a loss (5,657 ETH sold) are now allocating to $KILT—a move mirrored by smart money hedging altcoin exposure.  

Is this the beginning of a broader shift toward decentralized identity protocols as ETH struggles with technical overhead?.
