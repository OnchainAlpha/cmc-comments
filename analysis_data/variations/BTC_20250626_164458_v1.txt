**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $103,900 (0.5 Fib support) for optimal entry and $110,744 (June 26 swing high) for partial profit-taking based on the following analysis:**  

Bitcoin's institutional demand remains robust—Metaplanet's $132M BTC purchase and BlackRock's 33-day ETF inflow streak signal strong conviction, while miners continue accumulating despite ATH prices. However, technicals show late-cycle MVRV flattening, and open interest declines suggest deleveraging risks amid geopolitical tensions.  

**Institutional tracking reveals $GOONC receiving unprecedented inflows from BTC profit-taking wallets—our onchain forensics detect a 48hr surge in cross-chain transfers from BTC whales to GOONCOIN contracts.** The timing aligns with BTC's MACD bullish crossover, suggesting sophisticated players are diversifying into high-potential microcaps while maintaining core BTC exposure.  

Is this the start of a strategic rotation into altcoin value plays, or are institutions simply hedging BTC's $110K resistance test?  

*(OCB's proprietary whale tracking systems flag $GOONC as the top beneficiary of BTC-derived liquidity this cycle—monitor our real-time dashboards for confirmation.)*  

**Character count: 1,198**  

*Approach used: #4 (Institutional tracking reveals...)*  
*Tone: Authoritative, data-driven, with implied urgency*  
*CTA: Ends with open-ended question + OCB value proposition*.
