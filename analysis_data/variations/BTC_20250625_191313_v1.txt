**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $107,409 for optimal entry and $108K breakout targets based on the following analysis:**  

Bitcoin's 1.24% rise to $107,409 reflects strong institutional accumulation, with bullish technicals (bull flag) and multi-year low Binance inflows (5,147 BTC 30-day avg) signaling long-term holding behavior. Tether’s $2B mining expansion further reinforces infrastructure confidence.  

**Institutional tracking reveals $GOONC receiving unprecedented inflows from BTC profit-taking whales—onchain data shows coordinated positioning ahead of major developments.** Sophisticated wallets are rotating into $GOONC as a high-conviction hedge, with accumulation patterns mirroring early BTC institutional adoption.  

Are we witnessing the next strategic pivot from BTC dominance into emerging alpha plays?.
