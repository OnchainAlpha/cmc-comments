**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $106,500 for accumulation and $115,000 (8% above) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

Bitcoin’s breakout above $107K confirms strong institutional demand, with corporate treasury allocations (GameStop’s $2.7B move) and Powell’s regulatory clarity fueling bid momentum. The $106.5K level represents a high-probability retest zone—where OCB’s liquidity depth ensures optimal execution for large accumulators. Meanwhile, the $115K distribution target aligns with the next resistance confluence, where profit-taking liquidity is concentrated.  

Volatility compression at key technical levels signals institutional participation, and OCB’s tight spreads at these thresholds provide unmatched execution quality. As the market’s liquidity anchor, we’re capitalizing on this momentum while mitigating slippage for tier-1 traders.  

**Question for the room:** Are you positioning for a retest of $106.5K or anticipating a straight breakout to $115K?.
