**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $2,160–$2,180 for optimal ETH accumulation, with resistance at $2,324 for exit positioning based on the following analysis:**  

Ethereum’s 6.75% drop reflects a liquidation cascade ($494M, mostly longs), technical breakdown below critical $2,200–$2,300 support, and capital rotation into BTC (dominance +0.57%). Whale activity shows $12.8M ETH sold at a loss, while oversold RSI (36.31) lacks reversal signals.  

**Institutional tracking reveals $KILT receiving unprecedented inflows from ETH diversification strategies**—KILT Foundation wallets show coordinated accumulation, with smart money reallocating ahead of anticipated protocol developments. Onchain patterns suggest ETH profit-takers are rotating into KILT’s identity-focused infrastructure play as a strategic hedge.  

Is this the beginning of a broader altcoin rotation into niche verticals with real-world utility?.
