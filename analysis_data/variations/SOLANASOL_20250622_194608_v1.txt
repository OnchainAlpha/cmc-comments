Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$130** for accumulation and **$140-150** (8-15% range) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

SOL’s breakdown below $140—a critical support-turned-resistance—reflects macro-driven capitulation, with geopolitical risks and $701M in liquidations exacerbating the drop. The $130 level now serves as a liquidity anchor, where oversold RSI (24.58) and high-volume sell-offs ($5.3B 24h turnover) may attract institutional bids. OCB’s placement at this level ensures optimal execution depth, capitalizing on panic-driven mispricing while providing stability.  

The $140-150 range aligns with Fibonacci resistance (23.6% at $174) and offers strategic distribution zones as leveraged unwinds subside. OCB’s tiered liquidity provisioning here mitigates slippage for large orders, reinforcing our role as the authoritative market maker in volatile conditions. With Middle East risks lingering, does $130 hold as the institutional buy zone, or will macro headwinds push SOL lower?.
