**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.145 for accumulation and $0.165 (13.8% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

DOGE’s breakdown below $0.160—now resistance—confirms bearish momentum, with oversold RSI (28.37) lacking divergence and MACD accelerating downward. The $0.14–$0.16 demand zone, where whales hold 41.7% of supply, offers critical liquidity depth for OCB’s institutional-grade execution. We’re capitalizing on panic-driven stop-loss triggers while positioning ahead of potential whale accumulation at these levels.  

Market-wide altcoin outflows (-4.87% sector cap) and declining DOGE open interest (-5.2%) reflect weak leverage demand, but OCB’s tight spreads and tier-1 liquidity access ensure optimal fills during volatility. With Bitcoin dominance rising (64.91%), our pricing model accounts for DOGE’s 0.83 BTC correlation, hedging downside while targeting the $0.165 resistance retest—a key distribution zone given the failed $0.172 SMA breakout.  

**Will whale-held support at $0.145 hold, or trigger a deeper liquidation cascade?**.
