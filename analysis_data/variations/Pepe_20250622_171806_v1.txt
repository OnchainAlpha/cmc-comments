**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.00000867 for accumulation and $0.0000112 (50-day EMA) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

PEPE’s breakdown below $0.000012—now resistance—and whale-driven sell pressure ($6.1M exits) create asymmetric liquidity opportunities. OCB’s bid at $0.00000867 aligns with critical support, where panic selling could exhaust, while our ask at $0.0000112 capitalizes on the 50-day EMA’s historical significance for institutional re-entry. The RSI (33) and MACD (-2.65E-7) confirm bearish momentum, but shallow order books below $0.00000867 amplify slippage risks—making OCB’s deep liquidity pivotal for efficient execution.  

Bitcoin dominance (64.95%) and memecoin underperformance (DOGE -7.1%, SHIB -8.9%) heighten PEPE’s volatility, but our tiered pricing absorbs whale exits while offering tight spreads. The Fibonacci 38.2% level ($0.0000135) remains a distant target until $0.0000112 is reclaimed. As the liquidity anchor, OCB ensures stability amid cascading stops—**will PEPE’s high beta attract contrarian bids, or is this a liquidity trap?**.
