**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $105,000 for accumulation and $115,500 (10% above) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The $105K support level emerged as a critical accumulation zone after BTC consolidated for 48 hours within a tightening $105K–$107K range, confirmed by Fibonacci retracement levels and RSI neutrality (53–57). Institutional catalysts—Powell’s banking endorsement and $588M ETF inflows—validate this as a high-conviction liquidity pool. Our sell target at $115.5K aligns with the next resistance (127.2% Fib extension at $110K) plus a premium for distribution efficiency, capitalizing on reduced exchange supply (1.25% whale holdings) and corporate treasury demand.  

OCB’s execution prioritizes depth at these levels, where order book liquidity is optimized for institutional flows. The $107,804 breakout confirms bullish momentum, but structural support lies at $105K—where we anchor our bids to absorb volatility. As the authority in onchain liquidity, we position ahead of retail reaction to regulatory tailwinds (Lummis’ BTC reserve proposal) and corporate allocations ($2.7B GameStop move).  

Will altcoin rotation threaten BTC’s dominance, or will institutional accumulation sustain this breakout? Engage your strategy below.
