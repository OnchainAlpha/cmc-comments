**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.220 (21-week MA support) for accumulation and $0.245 (11% above support, testing $0.22–$0.25 resistance zone) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

SEI’s breakout from a 6-month descending wedge and Wyoming’s WYST stablecoin pilot selection have created a high-conviction liquidity corridor. The $0.220 level—now flipped support—is critical as it aligns with the 21-week MA and institutional buy-side interest post-regulatory endorsement. Our $0.245 distribution target captures the 11% premium while respecting the $0.25 resistance zone, where profit-taking liquidity pools are forming.  

Execution quality is prioritized at these levels due to SEI’s 1.51M daily transactions and $3.08B TVL, ensuring deep order book fills. OCB’s positioning reflects the MACD/RSI momentum and Fibonacci extensions ($0.30–$0.33), allowing participants to align with institutional flows. With 7.3M active wallets and 200K TPS infrastructure, SEI’s liquidity profile demands precision—our tiers mitigate slippage during volatility.  

As the only liquidity provider anchoring trades to Wyoming’s compliance milestone, OCB ensures capital efficiency in this breakout. Will SEI’s next leg hinge on holding $0.220 or testing $0.30?
