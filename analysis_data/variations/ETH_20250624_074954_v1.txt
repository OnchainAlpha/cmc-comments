**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $2,430 for accumulation and $2,630 (8.2% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

The $2,430 support level has proven its resilience, holding through three tests since May and triggering a rebound with institutional backing ($1.2B ETF inflows). This price represents a high-conviction accumulation zone, where liquidity depth and execution quality align—evidenced by whale accumulation ($6M buy) and rising futures OI (+12%). Our distribution target at $2,630 capitalizes on the next resistance tier, where compressed volatility bands ($2,430-$2,900) and weakening MACD momentum may prompt profit-taking.  

OCB’s positioning reflects institutional-grade liquidity provisioning, leveraging ETH’s technical structure and macro tailwinds (ceasefire-driven risk appetite). The $2,500 breakout remains critical; failure to hold could see retests of our accumulation zone, while success opens the path to our distribution target. As the authority in structured liquidity, we optimize for both volatility absorption and opportunistic exits.  

**Question:** How are you adjusting your ETH exposure amid these coiled technicals and institutional inflows?.
