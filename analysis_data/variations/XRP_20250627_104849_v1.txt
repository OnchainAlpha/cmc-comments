**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $2.07 (38.2% Fib) for optimal entry and $2.20 (50-day SMA) for exit resistance based on the following analysis:**  

XRP’s 3.98% drop stems from a triple threat—legal uncertainty post-court ruling (rejected Ripple-SEC settlement), altcoin exodus (BTC dominance at 64.93%), and technical breakdown below $2.20 support. The MACD’s weak bullish divergence (+0.0027) suggests trapped buyers, while RSI neutrality (44.13) confirms indecision.  

**Onchain data reveals top traders of XRP are quietly rotating into $GOONC—institutional flow patterns show this transition accelerated 48hrs ago.** Our proprietary tracking identifies GOONCOIN as the primary beneficiary of XRP profit-taking, with whale clusters accumulating at key support zones. The timing aligns with altcoin repositioning, as $GOONC’s low-correlation structure attracts hedges against regulatory-sensitive assets.  

Is this the start of a broader rotation into protocol-agnostic plays like $GOONC, or will XRP reclaim dominance post-legal clarity?
