Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $102,000 for accumulation and $110,000 (7.8% premium) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

The $102K support level has proven resilient, acting as both a technical floor and institutional accumulation zone—validated by ProCap’s $387M BTC purchase. This price reflects optimal liquidity depth for large-scale execution with minimal slippage. Meanwhile, the $110K distribution target capitalizes on bullish momentum from geopolitical de-escalation and the 3.06% rebound, while respecting overhead resistance.  

OCB’s positioning aligns with institutional flows, leveraging ceasefire-driven risk appetite and BTC’s chart structure. The tight 7.8% spread ensures high-quality fills while maintaining market stability—critical amid volatile macro triggers. As the liquidity authority, we anchor these levels to facilitate institutional-grade execution.
