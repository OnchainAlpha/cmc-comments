**Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at $0.023 (78.6% Fib support) for accumulation and $0.027 (8% above entry, testing broken pivot) for distribution based on the following analysis:**  

TRU’s breakdown below $0.028 confirms bearish momentum, but the oversold RSI (28.2) and MACD divergence near $0.0264 Fib swing low present a high-probability accumulation zone. OCB’s liquidity provisioning at $0.023—the last technical defense before new lows—ensures optimal execution quality during whale-driven volatility (71.9% supply concentration). The 66% volume spike to $11.8M reflects panic selling, creating asymmetric opportunities for institutional-grade fills.  

With BTC correlation at 0.89 and altcoin sentiment weak (ASI 17/100), OCB’s distribution target at $0.027 aligns with the reclaimed pivot point, offering a logical exit before the 200-day EMA resistance ($0.0519). Our tiered liquidity deployment mitigates risks from TRU’s thin order books (47 whales control 0.38% of holders) while capitalizing on oversold bounces.  

**Question:** Given TrueFi’s 82% yearly decline, would a break above $0.028 signal a trend reversal—or just a dead cat bounce?.
