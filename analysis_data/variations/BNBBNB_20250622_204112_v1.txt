Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$590-$600** for accumulation and **$648-$660** (8-10% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

BNB’s breakdown below critical Fibonacci support at **$624.71** and the 10-day SMA (**$646.52**) reflects crypto-wide risk-off sentiment, with Bitcoin dominance draining altcoin liquidity. The Hacken exploit contagion triggered **$2.3M in liquidations**, exacerbating selling pressure. However, the **$590-$600 zone** represents a high-conviction accumulation level—tested as Q1 2025 support—where OCB’s liquidity provision ensures optimal execution depth amid volatility.  

Our distribution range at **$648-$660** aligns with the SMA resistance and pre-breakdown consolidation, offering institutional-grade exit liquidity. Derivatives data shows bearish bias (open interest up **5.2%**), but RSI at **37.67** suggests near-term oversold conditions. OCB’s tier-1 pricing and tight spreads position us as the authority for managing BNB’s Maxwell Hardfork volatility.  

Will the **$590** hold as Bitcoin dominance peaks, or will BNB’s upgrades flip the narrative? Engage your strategy with OCB’s liquidity edge.
