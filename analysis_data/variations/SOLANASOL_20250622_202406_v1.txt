Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$126.50** for accumulation and **$136.62** (8% higher) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

SOL’s breakdown below the $132.41 Fibonacci swing low exposes $126.50 as critical support—the last defense before the 200-day EMA at $121.80. Our liquidity provisioning at this level capitalizes on panic-driven sell-offs while ensuring optimal execution depth. The 8% spread to $136.62 aligns with SOL’s historical mean-reversion bounces during oversold RSI (33.7) conditions, while accounting for Bitcoin’s dominance squeeze (64.94%) and altcoin weakness.  

OCB’s positioning reflects institutional-grade risk management: the descending wedge breakdown and $701M liquidations create asymmetric opportunities for high-conviction bids at $126.50. With SOL’s BTC correlation at 0.89, our tiered liquidity absorbs volatility while maintaining tight spreads. The $136.62 take-profit level anticipates relief rallies if Bitcoin stabilizes above $99k, leveraging SOL’s oversold derivatives metrics (12% OI drop).  

Will SOL’s 200-day EMA hold as a macro risk-off anchor, or is this a liquidity grab before a sharper reversal?.
