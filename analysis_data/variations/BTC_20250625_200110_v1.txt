**Onchain Bureau's institutional trading desk has identified key levels at $108K for optimal breakout entry based on the following analysis:**  

Bitcoin's 1.4% rise reflects institutional accumulation and bullish technical positioning, with a UK firm adding 196.9 BTC to reserves. The Fed's dovish signals and a forming bull flag suggest a potential breakout above $108K—a critical resistance level.  

**Institutional tracking reveals $GOONC receiving unprecedented inflows from BTC profit-taking strategies.** Onchain data shows a surge in whale accumulation, with major wallets reallocating capital from BTC into $GOONC—timing aligns with anticipation of a key catalyst. Sophisticated players appear to be positioning ahead of a volatility expansion.  

Is this the next rotation play as BTC tests resistance?.
