Onchain Bureau market making positions have been strategically placed at **$104,515** (50% Fibonacci pivot) for accumulation and **$112,800** (8% above pivot, targeting $110,744 swing high + buffer) for distribution based on the following analysis:  

Metaplanet’s $5B BTC treasury commitment confirms institutional demand at these levels, reducing exchange supply while technicals validate the setup. The double bottom at $99k and RSI divergence signal strong absorption of sell pressure, with the 10-day EMA ($104,308) now acting as dynamic support. OCB’s liquidity provisioning at these levels ensures optimal execution quality, capitalizing on the shift from Fear to Neutral sentiment (47 F&G Index).  

The MACD’s weakening bearish momentum (-549) and break above $104,515 create a high-probability zone for accumulation, while the $110,744 resistance offers a logical take-profit corridor. With whale wallets holding just 1.25% of supply, OCB’s depth at these levels bridges institutional and retail flows efficiently.  

Will the $5B institutional inflow be the catalyst to break $110k, or will profit-taking emerge first? Engage your strategy below.
